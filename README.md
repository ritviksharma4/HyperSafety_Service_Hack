# HyperSafety ML Service
## Mask-Detection & Face-Recognition Service for Safety in Work Places.

The HyperSafety ML Service of the [HyperSafety Frontend](https://github.com/HarshAmbasta/HyperSafety_Frontend_Hack) and the [HyperSafety Backend](https://github.com/ViVek6301/HyperSafety_Backend_Hack), an Employee Management Project in which images and details of Employees can be uploaded, which would then be used to detect whether or not Employees are wearing a mask in the Workplace. The [HyperSafety Frontend](https://github.com/HarshAmbasta/HyperSafety_Frontend_Hack) can then be used by the Higher-ups to check which Employees have been caught without a mask.
